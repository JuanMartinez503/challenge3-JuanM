# JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator made by Juan Martinez
The purpose of this challenge was to generate a random password based on criteria that we select. This app runs on the browser. We were given some starter code that contained all HTML/CSS and some Javascript. The owner of the starter code is Xandromus on github.com. I completed the rest of the JavaScript code. The repository contains HTML/CSS and Javascript.
